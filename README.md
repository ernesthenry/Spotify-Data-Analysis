### 3. Discovering the Top 10 Popular Songs in the Spotify Dataset

```python
a = sp_tracks
b = a[a['popularity'] > 90].sort_values('popularity', ascending=False)[:10]
b[['name', 'popularity', 'artists']]
```

- `a = sp_tracks`: This line of code assigns the 'sp_tracks' DataFrame to a new DataFrame variable `a`.
- `b = a[a['popularity'] > 90].sort_values('popularity', ascending=False)[:10]`: This line of code creates a new DataFrame `b` by selecting rows from the DataFrame `a` where the 'popularity' column is greater than 90. The DataFrame is then sorted in descending order based on the 'popularity' column, and the first 10 rows are selected. This effectively gives you the top 10 most popular tracks.
- `b[['name', 'popularity', 'artists']]`: This line of code selects specific columns ('name', 'popularity', and 'artists') from the DataFrame `b` created in the previous line. This will display the names, popularity values, and artist information of the top 10 most popular tracks.

### 4. Setting Release Date as the Index Column
